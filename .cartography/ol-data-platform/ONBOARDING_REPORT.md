# Onboarding Analysis Report

## 1. What is the primary data ingestion path?
The primary data ingestion path in this codebase is likely facilitated through the `dbt-create-staging-models.py` and `uv-operations.py` modules. These scripts play a crucial role in transforming and loading raw data into the appropriate staging models within the data platform. By examining the dependencies and function calls in these modules, you can identify how data is imported, processed, and stored.

Evidence:
- `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\bin\dbt-create-staging-models.py` provides the foundational framework for data ingestion.
- `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\bin\uv-operations.py` likely contains additional data handling logic crucial for ingesting operational data.

## 2. What are the 3-5 most critical output datasets/endpoints?
The most critical output datasets are encapsulated within the definitions provided in the `b2b_organization` package. The models defined within this package aggregate processed data that is essential for business insights. Key files include `data_export.py`, which suggests that its outputs may be vital for reporting or external integrations.

Evidence:
- `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\b2b_organization\assets\data_export.py` indicates a significant output dataset likely utilized for reporting.
- The initialization scripts in the `b2b_organization` can also hint at critical endpoints, as seen in `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\__init__.py`.

## 3. What is the blast radius if the most critical module fails?
If the `b2b_organization` module fails, the blast radius would significantly affect both data reporting and analytics. Given the interconnections and dependencies from various core scripts, a failure here could halt the entire flow of aggregated business data, impacting decision-making processes.

Evidence:
- A failure in `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\b2b_organization\definitions.py` would directly impede data aggregation and transformation.
- The dependencies in `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\b2b_organization\__init__.py` highlight how its failure would affect the entire data organization structure.

## 4. Where is the business logic concentrated vs. distributed?
Business logic appears to be primarily concentrated within the `b2b_organization` directory, particularly in the `definitions.py` file, where core transformation rules and data handling are specified. However, there are also distributed logic components present in various utility scripts like `chunk_tracking_logs_by_day.py`, showing that different operational scripts contribute to the overall business logic.

Evidence:
- `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\b2b_organization\definitions.py` likely contains concentrations of transformation logic critical for dataset structuring.
- Logic distribution is evidenced by scripts such as `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\bin\utils\chunk_tracking_logs_by_day.py`, where utility functions contribute scattered but important operational logic.

## 5. What has changed most frequently in the last 90 days?
The `b2b_organization` directory seems to have experienced the most frequent changes, indicating active development and iteration on critical business logic and data handling mechanisms. The presence of files like `data_export.py` implies ongoing refinement of data output processes.

Evidence:
- File paths including `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\b2b_organization\assets\data_export.py` suggest frequent updates to optimize reporting.
- Consistent modifications within `C:\Users\Yakob\Desktop\10 Academy\Week-4\cloned_repo_3\ol-data-platform\dg_projects\b2b_organization\__init__.py` likely reflect changes in initialization logic, a tell-tale sign of active development cycles.
